        <h2>Laura Tomasi</h2><h1>About Me</h1>
        
<p>I’m a highly motivated and detail-oriented Operational Analyst with a Master’s in International Humanitarian Affairs 
  and a strong foundation in data analysis, IT operations, and front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  I hold a Splunk Power User Certification (achieved just three months after joining my current team) and have completed both Splunk 
  Admin and ITSI training.</p>

<p>Over the past year at TSYS, I have rapidly advanced my data analytics and visualization capabilities,
   earning a central role within my team and winning the Circle of Excellence Award (2024). 
   I’ve successfully utilized Splunk to analyze data and build operational dashboards that provide leadership with key insights,
    while consistently outperforming team benchmarks. My ability to communicate complex data through visualization tools, Pivot Tables,
     and statistical methods has received positive feedback from high-profile clients.</p>

<p>I bring proficiency in SQL, Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, and am currently enhancing my skills in Python
   and Linux through independent study and practical application. Known for my critical thinking, strong time management,
    and proactive mindset, I consistently deliver results in high-pressure environments. 
    I’m also an effective communicator who engages confidently with stakeholders and leadership, always ready to take 
    on new responsibilities to help achieve team goals.</p>
